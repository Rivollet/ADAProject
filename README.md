# ADAProject: World recipes viz
Project for Applied Data Analysis class at EPFL.
*Groupe composed by: Loïc Veyssière, Maximilian Mordig, David Rivollet*

## Abstract
The objectif of our project is to analyze recipes from around the world in order to observe cultural differences between world regions. We are going to use interactive and intuitive vizualisation to show these differences expressed through the type of food populations eat. One example of such interactive graph would be to show by countries the nutriments contented in the recipies (ex: fat, proteins, salt, etc..). We can also analyze where in the world a specific ingredient (ex: beef, rice, butter, etc..) is mostly consumed.

## Data description
For this project, we will need a lot of recipes in order to have relevant conclusion. Moreover, these recipes need to have the specific information on their geographical origin. The american website [allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com/) is one of the most famous webpage for recipes storage on internet. Thousands of recipes are accessible with all the information needed.
